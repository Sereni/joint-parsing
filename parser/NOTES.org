* Add more features (in particular the ones from slide 16 of 04_machine_learnning.pdf)
   * Ideally one by one, but can be added in small groups to save time
   * Make a table for each case

* If reduce get's predicted when it's not allowed, take next best operation, not just 'shift'

* Learn and classify compound labels ('la-nmod, 'ra-subj', 'sh' etc.)
   * this would allow to extract richer features from partial trees

* Use JSON to output the model

* Implement averaged (multiclass) perceptron
